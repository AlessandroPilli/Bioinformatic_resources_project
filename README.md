In this repository, I present the code and assignment for the "Bioinformatic Resources" course, taught by Professor Romanel during the 2022/2023 academic year.

The main file of the project is [Liver_project](Liver_project.Rmd). To run the code, only Liver_project.Rmd and [Liver_hepatocellular_carcinoma.Rdata](Liver_hepatocellular_carcinoma.Rdata) are necessary; the other files are included to  certain processes.

Finally, you can find the assignment guidelines followed to perform the analysis in [Project_Bioinformatics_Resources_2023](./Project_Bioinformatics_Resources_2023.pdf).
