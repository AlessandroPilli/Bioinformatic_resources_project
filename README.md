In this repository, I present the code and assignment for the "Bioinformatic Resources" course, taught by Professor Romanel during the 2022/2023 academic year.

The main file of the project is [Liver_project](Liver_project.Rmd). To run the code, only Liver_project.Rmd and [Liver_hepatocellular_carcinoma.Rdata](Liver_hepatocellular_carcinoma.Rdata) are necessary; the other files are included to save time in specific long processes (the only NON mandatory file missing is the "enriched_transcription.RData", due to its large size it is available for download from a drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GuaCH-1GVpXf5vTpZ-SLIAIMOXKnymjA?usp=sharing)).

Finally, you can find the assignment guidelines followed to perform the analysis in [Project_Bioinformatics_Resources_2023](./Project_Bioinformatics_Resources_2023.pdf).
